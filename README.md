# Accessibility Procurement Pilot

LETTER OF INTEREST
ACCESSIBILITY PROCUREMENT PILOT ON BEHALF OF
TREASURY BOARD OF CANADA SECRETARIAT
AND
THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF CANADA


## 1. PURPOSE 

The purpose of this Letter of Interest is to notify industry, academia and other stakeholders of Canada’s intention to issue a Call for Proposals (CFP) in relation to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s Open by Default Pilot Portal and the Public Service Commission of Canada’s online recruitment system; to provide advance notice of the challenges (see section 3.1 for details of both challenges) for which Canada intends to seek proposals; and to provide industry the opportunity to give written feedback on the requirement and procurement strategy. The Rules of Engagement Participation Agreement for this activity are enclosed as Attachment 1 and the Industry Engagement Questions are enclosed as Attachment 2.

## 2. BACKGROUND 

The Government of Canada (“Canada”) has made commitments to advance openness and transparency in government. Today, however, the government faces barriers to being completely open to all Canadians. About 14% of the population reports having a disability that limits day-to-day activities and this percentage is projected to grow. Many Canadians also live with invisible disabilities and/or disabilities they don’t wish to report. Canada faces a clear imperative: to be inclusive, and to benefit from the contributions of citizens seeking to participate, government must continue to be fully accessible to persons with disabilities, both within government and in society more broadly.

The accelerating pace of digital change means that new tools are constantly being developed to enhance web accessibility. Accessibility issues can be both varied and complex, as can be the efforts to address these issues; however, emerging technologies show promise in helping to promote accessibility and thereby advance user experiences, support inclusion and provide consistency with international and national equality 
and human rights instruments.

Canada is looking to partner more closely with leading innovators in Canada and abroad to help address accessibility issues specifically relating to: 

- Documents on the Open by Default Pilot Portal, which is housed on the open government website, Open.canada.ca (“Open Government website”) as described in Attachment 3; and 
- Searching for and applying to federal government jobs as described in Attachment 4. 

### 2.1 EXISTING WEB STANDARDS, GUIDANCE, AND RESOURCES

For information, Canada uses the following resources to guide our web accessibility activities:
- Standard on Web Accessibility – Ensures the uniform application of a high level of web accessibility across Government of Canada websites and web applications. 
- Guidance on Implementing the Standard on Web Accessibility – Assists Government of Canada departments by providing tools, solutions and guidance to advance Web accessibility. 
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. 
- Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 - Provides guidelines for designing web content authoring tools that are both more accessible to authors with disabilities and designed to enable, support, and promote the production of more accessible web content by all authors.

Beyond the guidance listed above, the Canada takes inspiration from internationally recognized standards that support an improved user experience for users with accessibility requirements. The following should also be considered when creating web experiences and content:
- EN 301 549 – Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe – Specifies the functional accessibility requirements applicable to ICT products and services, together with a description of the test procedures and evaluation methodology for each accessibility requirement in a form that is suitable for use in public procurement within Europe.
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 W3C Working Draft 12 September 2017 - WCAG 2.1 extends Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0, and therefore to policies that reference WCAG 2.0.

## 3. REQUIREMENT

The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) and the Public Service Commission of Canada (PSC) have separate requirements for proposals to address the long standing barrier of accessibility in support of the Open by Default Pilot Portal and of job seekers searching for and applying to government jobs, respectively. The two challenges for which an open source software solution (“Solution”) (existing or developmental but not proprietary) will be sought are identified below.

Under the CFP, Bidders will be required to demonstrate how their proposed Solutions respond to and address one or both of the challenges.

### 3.1 TBS - OPEN BY DEFAULT PILOT PORTAL (CHALLENGE 1)

The Challenge for which Solutions will be sought on behalf of TBS is described in Attachment 3, Statement of Work for Open by Default Pilot Portal Challenge. Please note Attachment 3 is a draft document and is subject to change.

### 3.2 PSC – ACCESSIBILITY 10.0 RECRUITM ENT CHALLENGE (CHALLENGE 2)

The Challenge for which Solutions will be sought on behalf of PSC is described in Attachment 4, Statement of Work for Accessibility 10.0 Recruitment Challenge.

Please note Attachment 4 is a draft document and is subject to change.

## 4. ACQUISITION STRATEGY

It is anticipated t hat a CFP in French and English versions will be posted electronically on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS), namely the Buy and Sell website (https://buyandsell.gc.ca/). 

This requirement is subject to Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP).

### 4.1 CFP PROCESS 

Proposals submitted under the CFP will be a ssessed against criteria tabled in the mandatory and point-rated evaluation criteria (to be detailed in the resulting CFP solicitation document). Proposals which meet all mandatory criteria and the minimum point-rated criteria score will be placed in a pool of pre-qualified proposals for each of the challenges, provided that the total evaluated price does not exceed the budget available for the requirements. 


Following the evaluation process, Canada intends to award a contract to the three top ranked bidders from the pool of pre-qualified proposals for each of the challenges. The proposed contract will include three 3 Phases, Phases 2 and 3 will be optional. Under Phase 1 of the resulting contract, each contractor will be required to demonstrate a functional prototype of their Solution (defined as a minimum viable demonstration of capability) at a presentation to a panel anticipated to be held in Shawinigan, Quebec in mid-March 2018. The panel will observe the presentations and may recommend Contractor(s) to proceed to Phase 2.

The Contractor will be reimbursed its authorized travel and living expenses reasonably and properly incurred in the performance of the Work, at cost, without any allowance for profit and/or administrative overhead, in accordance with the meal, private vehicle and incidental expenses provided in Appendices B, C and D of the National Joint Council Travel Directive and with the other provisions of the directive referring to "travellers", rather than those referring to "employees".

All travel must have the prior authorization of the Technical Authority.

The maximum funding available for Phase 1 of any contract resulting from this CFP is $15,000.00, applicable Taxes excluded.

The maximum funding available for all phases of any contract resulting from this CFP is $320,000 for the Open by Default accessibility challenge and $115,000 for the Accessibility 10.0 Recruitment challenge, applicable taxes and travel and living expenses are excluded.

## 5. GOVERNMENT OF CANADA APPLICABLE POLICIES

Suppliers interested in doing business with the federal government are encouraged to register in the Supplier Registration Information System (https://srisupplier.contractscanada.gc.ca) to be assigned a Procurement Business Number (PBN). Bidders responding to the resulting CFP must be in possession of a PBN.

The Canadian Content Policy does not apply to this requirement. 

The Code of Conduct for Procurement and Public Services and Procurement Canada’s Integrity Provisions will apply. The Contractor will own Intellectual Property Rights in Foreground Information.

## 6. LICENCING

Solutions developed (not pre-existing) for either challenge must be licenced under the MIT Licence. Where Bidders are leveraging existing open source projects, adopting the parent licence of the open source software project is acceptable, where the licence is approved by the Open Source Institute. A list of approved licences is available at the following link: Open Source Licences (https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical). 

Under any contract resulting from the CFP, the Contractor will be required to deposit the Solution’s source code in a public facing repository on the Git Hub platform (https://github.com) – under an open source license as specified above.

# Attachment 3 

Statement of Work for Open by Default Pilot Portal Challenge

## 1. Introduction

The Government of Canada has outlined commitments to advance openness and transparency through Action Plans on Open Government submitted to the Open Government Partnership since 2012. One of the core mandates expressed in these action plans is to advance openness through the open government website, open.canada.ca. 

The Open Government website was initially launched as a pilot, data.gc.ca, in 2011. The pilot open data portal then expanded to include various information resources and to facilitate engagement on the open government initiative and associated activities. In keeping with Canada’s initial strategy on open government, the Open Government website’s architecture is built around the pillars of open data, open information and open dialogue, and its infrastructure is built on open source solutions: CKAN, Drupal and Solr. As Canada continues to advance the open government initiative and to release a growing number of resources, it has become apparent that the accessibility of content needs to be improved. There is also a desire to do more in terms of engaging with users and visitors through the Open Government website.

Canada is committed to removing barriers to access for Government information and services. With that in mind, Canada is mandated to ensure that all websites and web applications adhere to the AA level of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. These requirements are more specifically spelled out for application to Canada in the Standard on Web Accessibility. 

New resources of information are constantly being added to the Open Government website and the future vision is for it to become a hub of data, information and opportunities to participate and learn. Early research indicates that a majority of users are seeking data of one type or another, with a smaller but significant group looking for opportunities to participate or engage with government.

As Canada’s work on open government advances, there are opportunities to improve the user experience of its online tools, including improving access to digital publications and draft documents made available by the Government of Canada.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 The Open by Default Pilot Portal (http://pilot.open.canada.ca/open-by-default-pilot) 

The Open by Default Pilot Portal, launched in July 2017, is the newest component of the Open Government website. It is an online beta site where various types of non-sensitive federal-level documents in draft format (i.e. working documents) are made publicly available, providing users with insight into what Government of Canada employees are working on (e.g., presentations, speaking notes, infographics, annual reports, etc.). The Open by Default Pilot Portal leverages existing operational systems that are used to power open.canada.ca, including CKAN, Drupal and Solr. It also leverages GCDocs, an internal records management tool. The technical architecture of the Open by Default Pilot Portal, a separate, beta-stage instance within open.canada.ca, mirrors that of the Open Government Portal. All source code for the architecture is available on GitHub for reuse here : https://github.com/open-data. 

The Open by Default Portal consolidates draft documents (“Digital Assets”) provided by four pilot departments: Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Heritage, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. However, additional partner departments will be on-boarded in the future .The Open by Default Pilot Portal includes Digital Assets that are works in progress which have not necessarily been created or formatted for compliance with web accessibility standards. 

Currently, the Open by Default Portal contains approximately 550 Digital Assets in common formats such as .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pdf, and .png. The collection contains such Digital Assets as draft policies, internal draft documentation on systems, and presentations. It is expected that future Digital Assets holdings on the portal could be expanded to include audio and video formats. It is also expected that the volume on content could expand to include 100,000s of digital assets over the next few y
ears, as departments are onboarded.

## 3. Challenge 

TBS has a requirement for an open source software solution (“Solution”) (existing or developmental but not proprietary) to enhance and improve the accessibility of both current and future Digital Assets housed on the Open by Default Pilot Portal. Proposed Solutions must also be compatible with the Open Government website’s existing digital infrastructure.

The following illustrative list provides examples of accessibility issues Solutions may address in responding to the challenge. This list is non-exhaustive; Solutions may address any of these accessibility issues or may address accessibility issues not listed below. 

- Lack of ability within the system to automatically transform Digital Assets created in both official languages, into Digital Assets which conform to a minimum of WCAG 2.0 AA. Digital assets which additionally conform to WCAG 2.1 and/or EN 301 549 would be preferred. 
- Lack of ability within the system to programmatically generate conforming alternate versions of Digital Assets available through the Open by Default Pilot Portal in a variety of formats, and in both official languages, such as PDF/UA, EPUB3, and ODF; 
- Lack of ability within the system to programmatically generate alternate versions of Digital Assets 
available through the Open by Default Pilot Portal in a variety of braille formats such as .BRF and .BRL in both official languages;
- Lack of ability within the system to generate and embed within Digital Assets an accessibility compliance report for Digital Assets in both official languages, against at a minimum WGAC 2.0 AA standards, compliance to other web accessibility standards would be preferred; 
- Lack of ability within the system to programmatically add system generated alt text / descriptive text in both official languages to images; 
- Lack of ability within the system to programmatically generate transcripts of English and French voice audio recordings ; 
- Lack of ability within the system to generate animated American Sign Language or Quebec Sign Language from spoken word audio or video; 
- Lack of ability within the system to programmatically generate described video, transcripts, closed captioning for video content created in both official languages;
- The absence of the ability for the system to assign and display Flesch-Kincaid Reading grade level for English content or Scolarius score for French content;
- The absence of the ability for the system to programmatically reduce the reading grade level of the content to a target of grade 8, in accordance with WCAG 2.0 AAA; and,
- Lack of available document templates that force users to generate documents in a method that complies with, at a minimum WCAG 2.0 AA. Templates which additionally conform to WCAG 2.1 and/or EN 301 549 would be preferred.
